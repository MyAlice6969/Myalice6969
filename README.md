# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m MyAlice6969!

As an undergraduate student in Financial Technology from the Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology (PTIT), I bring one year of practical experience in data analysis within the e-commerce and insurance sectors. My projects primarily involve developing Power BI dashboards for daily operational tracking, KPI monitoring, and comparative analysis across various periods and categories. I'm keen to leverage my analytical skills to provide valuable insights and contribute to business growth.
